## Overview

The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to predict whether a passenger aboard the Titanic survived or not based on various factors such as age, gender, ticket class, and embarkation port. This project is inspired by the historical sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912, where some individuals were more likely to survive than others due to factors like proximity to lifeboats and social status

## Dependencies

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x: You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Python Libraries


- NumPy: For numerical operations.
-TensorFlow:For standard mathematical operations or tensors.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization.


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the code and obtain  Titanic Survival Prediction
1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sameera0103/Titanic_Survival.git  
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd  Titanic Survival Prediction 
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Install the required Python libraries as mentioned in the "Dependencies" section.

4. **Data Preparation:**

   We loaded  Titanic Survival Prediction dataset from keras and preprocessed them.

5. **Configure Parameters:**

   Open the `config.py` file and set the required parameters, such as  Titanic Survival Prediction,number of death,number of injured.

6. **Run the Code:**

   Execute the main script to analyze Generative Model for  Titanic Survival Prediction.

   ```bash
   python  Titanic Survival Prediction.py
   ```

   The script will perform data preprocessing,visulisation and classification.
7. **View Results:**

   The results and visualizations will be saved in the `output` folder. You can explore them to gain insights into  Titanic Survival Prediction.
## Configuration

You can customize the behavior of the code by modifying the parameters in the `config.py` file. Some of the key configurations include:

- `DATA_FILE`: Path to the input transaction data file.
- `OUTPUT_DIR`: Path to the output directory where results will be saved.
- Other parameters related to visualization and data preprocessing.

## Results

The code will generate various insights and visualizations, including:

-This model is trained on the preprocessed dataset containing information about Titanic passengers, including features like age, gender, ticket class, and fare. 
-The goal of this step is to create a predictive model that can accurately classify whether a passenger survived or not based on the provided features. 
-After training the model, it can be evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its performance in predicting survival outcomes.

This project is based on the principles of data preprocessing,visualisation and classification of spam and ham. The code uses open-source libraries and is intended for educational and practical use.
